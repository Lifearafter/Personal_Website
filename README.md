## First Website Project
### Learning HTML and CSS

HTML is an easy language to learn and implement, the real challenge is in actuallity designing and styling the website.
Having learned some basic CSS, I can already tell it is a completely different beast compared to HTML.
Experience is key. It dictates what we do and how we solve problems. And for CSS experience is key.
This is my first project using HTML and CSS, having created a basic website, I only need to style it now.
