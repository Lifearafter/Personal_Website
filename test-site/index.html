                    <p> <b>First ever html web page.</b> <br/>
                        Doctype is a head that the browser uses to identify the type of file presented in the page.<br/>
                        After declaring DOCTYPE, we have the html opening and closing brackets representing all that we write
                            after as html elements.<br/>
                        The head is the part of the html that contains the meta tags, links, scripts, and stylesheets.<br/>
                        The body is the part of the html that contains the content of the page.<br/>
                        The img attribute allows us to display the images<br/>
                        The src is what it uses to find the image.<br/>
                        While the alt is alternative text which is used when the image cannot be displayed<br/>
                        Most html tags are container tags, everything else is just a tag.<br/>
                        The html tag is the parent of the head and body tags.<br/>
                        The head and body tags are the child of the html tag.<br/>
                        The head and body are sibling tags.<br/>
                        The img and paragph tags are grandchilds of the html tag, and the child tags of body tags.<br/>
                        Some tags are container tags while others are content tags.<br/>
                        A meta tag is basically a tag that defines information about the our file.<br/>
                        Character set is the encoding of the file. Charset is used to specify the character set of the file.<br/>
                        UTF-8 is the default encoding for html 5.<br/>
                        A pageâ€™s meta description tag is displayed as part of the search snippet 
                            in a search engine results page. <br/>
                        Attribute inside the tag give the tag some custom information.<br/>
                        Name, Charset, and Content are attributes.<br/>
                        Name tells the meta tag thae type of information given to it. And content is the information.<br/>
                        Headers are like the same as github ###### since they just give a Heading to the file<br/>
                        The paragh tags hold most of the content of the page such that it allows for articles to be written.<br/>
                        One paragraph tag is one paragraph!<br/>
                        The break tag is used to break the paragraph.<br/>
                        There can also be single tags like the br/ tag and hr/ tag can also be sometimes written
                            without the /<br/>
                        The big and small tags can also be used to make the text bigger or smaller.<br/>
                        The sub and super tags can be used to add subsscipts and super scritps like H<sub>2</sub>O.<br/>
                        And the super tag is like this y = 2x<sup>2</sup><br/>
                        I watched this <a href="https://youtu.be/pQN-pnXPaVg?t=1873">freeCodeCamp</a> video on HTML.<br/>
                        I also watched this <a href="https://youtu.be/qz0aGYrrlhU?t=1548">Programming with Mosh</a> video 
                        on basics of web dev.<br/>
                        If you give the paragraph tag the style attribute and add the attribute value of color and
                            the color you want it to be, it will change the color of the paragraph.<br/>
                        You can also change the background color
                            <p style = "color:red; background-color:black">For example, this this is colored red. with background colors too.</p>
                        The styling can be added to any text tag I think.<br/>
                        The styling is not native to html its a css feature.<br/>
                        Most website have a header, a body, and a footer, html has tags for those.<br/>
