                            <h3>Main HTML structure</h3>
                            Doctype is a head that the browser uses to identify the type of file presented in the page.<br/>
                            After declaring DOCTYPE, we have the html opening and closing brackets representing all that we write
                                after as html elements.<br/>
                            The head is the part of the html that contains the meta tags, links, scripts, and stylesheets.<br/>
                            The body is the part of the html that contains the content of the page.<br/>
                            Most website have a header, a main, and a footer, html has tags for those.<br/>

                            <h3>Information about HTML tag structuring</h3>
                            Attributes inside the tag give the tag some custom information.<br/>
                            The img attribute allows us to display the images<br/>
                            The src is what it uses to find the image.<br/>
                            While the alt is alternative text which is used when the image cannot be displayed<br/>
                            Most html tags are container tags, everything else is just a tag.<br/>
                            The html tag is the parent of the head and body tags.<br/>
                            The head and body tags are the child of the html tag.<br/>
                            The head and body are sibling tags.<br/>
                            The img and paragph tags are grandchilds of the html tag, and the child tags of body tags.<br/>
                            Some tags are container tags while others are content tags.<br/>

                            <h3>Information about Meta Tags</h3>
                            A meta tag is basically a tag that defines information about the our file.<br/>
                            Character set is the encoding of the file. Charset is used to specify the character set of the file.<br/>
                            UTF-8 is the default encoding for html 5.<br/>
                            A pageâ€™s meta description tag is displayed as part of the search snippet 
                                in a search engine results page. <br/>
                            Name, Charset, and Content are attributes in the meta tag.<br/>
                            Name tells the meta tag thae type of information given to it. And content is the information.<br/>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3>Main HTML Tags</h3>
                            Headers are like the same as github ###### since they just give a Heading to the file<br/>
                            The paragh tags hold most of the content of the page such that it allows for articles to be written.<br/>
                            One paragraph tag is one paragraph!<br/>
                            The break tag is used to break the paragraph.<br/>
                            There can also be single tags like the br/ tag and hr/ tag can also be sometimes written
                                without the /<br/>
                            The big and small tags can also be used to make the text bigger or smaller.<br/>
                            The sub and super tags can be used to add subsscipts and super scritps like H<sub>2</sub>O.<br/>
                            And the super tag is like this y = 2x<sup>2</sup><br/>
                            For articles you can use a article tag that can then have sections using the section tags, 
                                this is mainly for the purposes of search engine optimizations.<br/>
                            It is recommneded to have headers for each section and have all the headers follow a hierarchy.<br/>
                        </section>

                            <h3>Styling in HTML using CSS</h3>
                            You mainly use CSS to style HTML content. <br/>
                            Basic sytling includes adding a text color or background color. <br/>
                            If you give the paragraph tag the style attribute and add the attribute value of color and the color you want it to be, 
                                it will change the color of the paragraph text.<br/>
                            You can also change the background color of the paragraph.<br/>
                            The styling can be added to any tags that include some text content.<br/>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3>Links in HTML</h3>
                            Links are available to be used in html by using the html tag "a" with a href attribute that holds the URL.<br/>
                            You can add a Link text by adding the text outside the the attrbute value but before the closing tag.<br/>
                            You dont have to only have simple link text you can next elements inside the "a" tag. <br/>
                            Use the target attribute inside the tag to specify where the link opens to. <br/>
                            To link between pages of the website you can use href attribute with a relative URL.<br/>

                            <h3>Images and Videos</h3>
                            Images in html can be displayed simply using img tag with the src attribute.<br/>
                            It is recommended to have a alt attribute for the image so that in case of image not found
                                there is some thing to be displayed.<br/>
                            Video is also very similar in the fact that you can display a video using a video tag.<br/>
                            Videos also have a source tag that is used to display the video if it is in the files.<br/>
                            You can also display a video from a website by using the iframe.<br/>
                            Vidoes also have other attributes like controls, autoplay, and loop.<br/>
                            You can also resize any image or video by defining the witdh and/or height attributes.<br/>
                            If only one attribute is defined the other will be set by html depending on the aspect ratio<br/>

                            <h3>Lists</h3>
                            Lists are used to display a list of items.<br/>
                            Lists can be ordered or unordered depending on the tag used.<br/>
                            Unordered lists are used with the ul tag.<br/>
                            Ordered lists are used with the ol tag.<br/>
                            Lists items displayed with the li tag.<br/>
                            You can nest tags within li tags.<br/>
                            With il tag you can also add a type attribute to the list which defines the type of character<br/>
                            A, a, i, I, and the default 1, are the values that can be assigned to the Type attribute.<br/>

                            Containers in HTML are extremely useful for styling and organization.<br/>
                            Two of the most used containers being divs and spans.<br/>
                            Divs are block containers that instead of taking just a line of text, they take up a block of space.<br/>
                            Spans are inline containers that take up a line of text.<br/>
                            There are other containers, but mostly divs and spans are used.<br/>
                            You can use the class tag on any container to give it a name, that can then be used by the stylesheets.<br/>

                            The type attribute is used to define the type of input.<br/>
