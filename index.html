                            <h3>Main HTML structure</h3>
                            Doctype is a head that the browser uses to identify the type of file presented in the page.<br/>
                            After declaring DOCTYPE, we have the html opening and closing brackets representing all that we write
                                after as html elements.<br/>
                            The head is the part of the html that contains the meta tags, links, scripts, and stylesheets.<br/>
                            The body is the part of the html that contains the content of the page.<br/>
                            Most website have a header, a main, and a footer, html has tags for those.<br/>

                            <h3>Information about HTML tag structuring</h3>
                            Attributes inside the tag give the tag some custom information.<br/>
                            The img attribute allows us to display the images<br/>
                            The src is what it uses to find the image.<br/>
                            While the alt is alternative text which is used when the image cannot be displayed<br/>
                            Most html tags are container tags, everything else is just a tag.<br/>
                            The html tag is the parent of the head and body tags.<br/>
                            The head and body tags are the child of the html tag.<br/>
                            The head and body are sibling tags.<br/>
                            The img and paragph tags are grandchilds of the html tag, and the child tags of body tags.<br/>
                            Some tags are container tags while others are content tags.<br/>

                            <h3>Information about Meta Tags</h3>
                            A meta tag is basically a tag that defines information about the our file.<br/>
                            Character set is the encoding of the file. Charset is used to specify the character set of the file.<br/>
                            UTF-8 is the default encoding for html 5.<br/>
                            A pageâ€™s meta description tag is displayed as part of the search snippet 
                                in a search engine results page. <br/>
                            Name, Charset, and Content are attributes in the meta tag.<br/>
                            Name tells the meta tag thae type of information given to it. And content is the information.<br/>

                            <h3>Main HTML Tags</h3>
                            Headers are like the same as github ###### since they just give a Heading to the file<br/>
                            The paragh tags hold most of the content of the page such that it allows for articles to be written.<br/>
                            One paragraph tag is one paragraph!<br/>
                            The break tag is used to break the paragraph.<br/>
                            There can also be single tags like the br/ tag and hr/ tag can also be sometimes written
                                without the /<br/>
                            The big and small tags can also be used to make the text bigger or smaller.<br/>
                            The sub and super tags can be used to add subsscipts and super scritps like H<sub>2</sub>O.<br/>
                            And the super tag is like this y = 2x<sup>2</sup><br/>
                            For articles you can use a article tag that can then have sections using the section tags, 
                                this is mainly for the purposes of search engine optimizations.<br/>
                            It is recommneded to have headers for each section and have all the headers follow a hierarchy.<br/>

                            <h3>Styling in HTML using CSS</h3>
                            You mainly use CSS to style HTML content. <br/>
                            Basic sytling includes adding a text color or background color. <br/>
                            If you give the paragraph tag the style attribute and add the attribute value of color and the color you want it to be, 
                                it will change the color of the paragraph text.<br/>
                            You can also change the background color of the paragraph.<br/>
